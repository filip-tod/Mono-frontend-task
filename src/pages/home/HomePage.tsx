          <p className={'mt-2 text-base'}>In the Navigation Bar we have the Vehicle List that shows all the cars we have in our DataBase with the key MakeId which is simply the id of the maker of the vehicle</p>
          <p className={'mt-2 text-base'}>After that we have the car makers in which we can create a new Car maker like Ford or BMW and create a new car model which has the makers key</p>
          <p className={'mt-2 text-base'}>For this application, I will limit myself to only the values I need to type in and I will ignore some features I would like to implement at some time like the car makers logo and maybe some images of the car and a system that represents buying or selling cars</p>
