            This is a simple web application where I demonstrate my knowledge of React, state management,
            and working with API calls. It allows users to manage car brands and their associated car models.
          </p>
          <p className={'mt-2 text-base'}>
            The application features basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling the addition,
            modification, and deletion of car brands and models in a structured way.
          </p>
          <p className={'mt-2 text-base'}>
            In the Car Models section, you can see all the cars we have stored, each connected to a specific car maker.
            You can also navigate to the Car Makers section to add new brands (e.g., Ford, BMW) and associate car models with them.
          </p>

            While the current version focuses on core functionality, in the future, I plan to expand it with features
            like adding car images, logos, and even a basic "shop" system where users can simulate buying and selling cars.
          </p>
          <p className={'mt-2 text-base'}>
            Overall, this project is a way to show how React, MobX, Tailwind CSS and API integrations can be used to create a functional,
            interactive user interface.
